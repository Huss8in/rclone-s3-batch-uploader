Basically, we need a batch script (not bash) to run on a Windows PowerShell machine. The script should:

- Take a directory as an input argument.
- Take AWS S3 bucket credentials. usig rclone
- Loop through all files and subdirectories in that directory.
- Upload each file to S3 using rclone (an open-source command line tool).
- The script will loop through folders and run the copy command.
- The key focus is on error handling: it must catch any exceptions and retry to continue reliably.
